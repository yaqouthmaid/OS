--------------- project one description --------------- 

The project is a simulation for some of the CPU scheduling algorithms and making a comparison between them.

Write a program that does the following:

1- Simulates the scheduling algorithms FCFS, SJF, RR, Priority, Multilevel Feedback Queues.

2- Create 8 processes in the ready queue with a random CPU-burst for each process between 10 & 999 units of time. You should use a suitable data structure for each process representing the PCB which may contain the data you feel you need it in your program.

3- When creating the processes, assign some kind of order for their arrival time and priority .

4- For RR, use a slice time (quantum, Q = 40units). k 
5- In multilevel feedback Queue, consider 3 queues, Q1: RR with 40 units Q2: RR with 400 units. Q3: FCFS

6- For each of the scheduling algorithms above, you should compute the average turnaround time (ATT) and average waiting time (AWT).

7- Repeat steps (2) to (6) for 100 times, 1000 times, 10000 times, and 100000 times.

8- Create a table summarizing your results showing ATT & AWT for all cases
